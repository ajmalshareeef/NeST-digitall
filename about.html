    <p>&nbsp Hello! I'm an AI Developer passionate about creating intelligent systems that bridge the gap between complex algorithms and real-world applications. With expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, I thrive at building data-driven solutions that enhance user experiences and drive innovation.

        I have hands-on experience working with frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn, coupled with solid programming skills in Python, C++, and SQL. Whether it’s designing predictive models, deploying neural networks, or developing chatbots, I enjoy solving challenging problems and optimizing solutions for performance and scalability.
        
        I’m particularly interested in the ethical implications of AI, ensuring that my work aligns with fairness, transparency, and inclusivity. When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading research papers, contributing to open-source projects, and staying updated with the latest advancements in artificial intelligence.</p>
